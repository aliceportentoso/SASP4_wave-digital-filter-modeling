# Wave Digital Filter modeling
<br>
 The topic of this homework is Wave Digital Filter (WDF) modeling. You will be required to model a
 three-way crossover network in the Wave Digital (WD) domain starting from a reference analog circuit.
 Electroacoustic transducers are often characterized by three drivers; a woofer, a midrange speaker
 and a tweeter. A crossover network is employed to filter the input audio signal such that low-frequency
 sounds are diverted to the woofer, mid-frequency sounds to the midrange speaker and high-frequency
 sounds to the tweeter.
